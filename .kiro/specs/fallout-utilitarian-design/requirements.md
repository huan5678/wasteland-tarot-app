# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines a comprehensive design system that merges **Fallout's retrofuturistic aesthetic** with **Utilitarian design principles** to create a cohesive, functional, and immersive visual identity for the Wasteland Tarot platform. The design system will emphasize pragmatism, clarity, and efficiency while maintaining the iconic post-apocalyptic atmosphere of the Fallout universe.

The current implementation already features Fallout-themed colors (Pip-Boy green, vault blue, radiation orange) and terminal effects. This specification will formalize and extend these design patterns into a complete design system that balances aesthetic appeal with functional excellence, ensuring every visual element serves a clear purpose while delivering an authentic wasteland experience.

**Business Value**: A well-structured design system improves development efficiency, ensures consistent user experience, enhances accessibility compliance, and strengthens brand identity in the gaming + mysticism crossover market.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Design Philosophy Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear design philosophy documentation, so that I can make consistent design decisions aligned with both Fallout aesthetics and utilitarian principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the design system is documented THEN it SHALL define "Utilitarian Fallout" design principles that prioritize function over form while maintaining thematic consistency
2. WHEN designers create new components THEN they SHALL follow the documented principle that every visual element must serve a clear functional purpose (information hierarchy, user guidance, or interaction feedback)
3. WHEN evaluating design decisions THEN the system SHALL provide criteria that balance Fallout's retrofuturistic charm with clean, efficient layouts and minimal decorative elements
4. WHERE visual complexity conflicts with usability THEN the design system SHALL prioritize usability while maintaining thematic atmosphere through subtle effects and color schemes

### Requirement 2: Typography System

**User Story:** As a user, I want readable and accessible text displays, so that I can consume information efficiently in the Fallout-themed interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying body text THEN the system SHALL use monospace fonts (JetBrains Mono or system monospace) with minimum 16px size for optimal readability
2. WHEN displaying numeric data THEN the system SHALL apply the Doto font family (already implemented via `--font-doto` variable) with tabular-nums for consistent alignment
3. WHEN creating heading hierarchies THEN the system SHALL define 6 semantic levels (H1-H6) with clear size differentiation and appropriate line-height ratios (1.2-1.5)
4. IF text appears on complex backgrounds THEN the system SHALL ensure WCAG AA contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text)
5. WHERE long-form content is displayed THEN the typography system SHALL set optimal line lengths (45-75 characters) and adequate line spacing (1.5-1.75 for body text)

### Requirement 3: Functional Color System

**User Story:** As a designer, I want a purpose-driven color palette, so that each color communicates specific meaning and improves usability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the color system is implemented THEN it SHALL organize existing Fallout colors into functional categories: navigation, status indicators, interactive elements, and informational backgrounds
2. WHEN indicating system status THEN the system SHALL use:
   - Success: Pip-Boy green (#00ff88) for completed actions

2. WHEN implementing form inputs THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual states (default, focus, error, disabled, success) with visible focus indicators (3px outline offset 2px) and associated helper text patterns
3. WHEN displaying cards or containers THEN the system SHALL use subtle borders (1-2px), minimal shadows (following Pip-Boy aesthetic), and clear content hierarchies
4. WHERE interactive feedback is needed THEN components SHALL provide haptic feedback (via Web Audio API), visual state changes (100-200ms transitions), and clear affordances
5. IF components contain complex interactions THEN the system SHALL include loading states, empty states, and error states with helpful messaging

### Requirement 6: Iconography and Visual Elements

**User Story:** As a designer, I want a consistent icon system, so that visual language remains coherent across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using icons THEN the system SHALL maintain a single consistent style (outlined, monochromatic) with standardized sizes (16px, 20px, 24px, 32px, 48px)
2. WHEN icons represent actions THEN they SHALL be paired with text labels for clarity, except in space-constrained contexts where tooltips must be provided
3. WHEN creating custom Fallout-themed icons THEN they SHALL follow utilitarian principles with simple, recognizable shapes that work at small sizes (16px minimum)
4. WHERE icons indicate status THEN the system SHALL combine icon shape with functional color coding and sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
5. IF icons are interactive THEN they SHALL have appropriate hover/focus states and meet minimum touch target sizes (44x44px)

### Requirement 7: Motion and Animation Principles

**User Story:** As a user, I want subtle, purposeful animations, so that the interface feels responsive without being distracting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN animations are implemented THEN the system SHALL limit duration to 100-300ms for UI feedback, 400-600ms for transitions, and avoid animations longer than 1 second unless critical
2. WHEN elements enter/exit the viewport THEN the system SHALL use subtle fade or slide effects (max 20px movement) rather than elaborate animations
3. WHEN providing interaction feedback THEN the system SHALL use Fallout-appropriate effects (scanline flicker, terminal cursor blink, radiation pulse) sparingly and with purpose
4. WHERE users have motion sensitivity THEN the system SHALL respect `prefers-reduced-motion` settings and disable non-essential animations
5. IF background effects are used THEN the system SHALL ensure they remain subtle (max 30% opacity) and don't interfere with content readability

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the interface to adapt seamlessly to my device, so that I have an optimal experience regardless of screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing for mobile THEN the system SHALL prioritize vertical scrolling over horizontal, with touch-friendly controls and simplified navigation patterns
2. WHEN content adapts between breakpoints THEN the system SHALL reflow layouts gracefully without jarring jumps or content loss
3. WHEN displaying data tables or complex components THEN the system SHALL provide mobile-optimized alternatives (stackable cards, horizontal scroll with indicators, or simplified views)
4. WHERE screen real estate is limited THEN the system SHALL implement progressive disclosure patterns (collapsible sections, tabs, modals) to reduce cognitive load
5. IF viewport orientation changes THEN the system SHALL maintain functionality and readability in both portrait and landscape modes

### Requirement 10: Performance and Optimization Standards

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast-loading interfaces, so that I can access content quickly without waiting for heavy assets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading visual assets THEN the system SHALL limit custom font usage to 2-3 families with subset characters, use system fonts as fallbacks, and implement font-display: swap
2. WHEN applying effects THEN the system SHALL use CSS transforms and opacity for animations (GPU-accelerated), avoid layout-triggering properties, and utilize will-change sparingly
3. WHEN implementing backgrounds THEN the system SHALL generate effects via CSS gradients and SVG patterns rather than large image files where possible
4. WHERE critical rendering path is affected THEN the system SHALL inline critical CSS, defer non-critical styles, and minimize render-blocking resources
5. IF complex visual effects are used THEN the system SHALL provide reduced-quality fallbacks for low-end devices and respect user's data-saver preferences

### Requirement 11: Design Token System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized design tokens, so that I can maintain consistency and make global changes efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining design tokens THEN the system SHALL document all CSS custom properties (colors, spacing, typography, borders, shadows) in a single source of truth
2. WHEN tokens are updated THEN changes SHALL propagate automatically throughout the application via CSS variable inheritance
3. WHEN creating component variants THEN they SHALL reference tokens rather than hard-coded values for maintainability
4. WHERE theme switching is required THEN the token system SHALL support light/dark mode variations (though dark mode is default for Fallout aesthetic)
5. IF new tokens are added THEN the system SHALL follow established naming conventions (e.g., `--color-{category}-{variant}`, `--spacing-{size}`)

### Requirement 12: Documentation and Design Resources

**User Story:** As a team member, I want comprehensive design documentation, so that I can implement features correctly without constant consultation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN the system SHALL provide a quick-start guide with code examples for common patterns (buttons, forms, layouts, cards)
2. WHEN implementing components THEN developers SHALL have access to a component library reference showing all variants, states, and usage guidelines
3. WHEN making design decisions THEN the documentation SHALL include decision flowcharts (e.g., "Which button variant should I use?") and best practice guidelines
4. WHERE component behavior is complex THEN the system SHALL provide interactive examples or code sandbox links for experimentation
5. IF design system updates occur THEN the documentation SHALL include changelog with migration guides for breaking changes

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly **not** included in this specification:

- **Brand guidelines beyond UI design**: Marketing materials, social media templates, or promotional assets
- **3D asset creation**: While Fallout aesthetic is important, this spec focuses on 2D UI design system
- **Backend design patterns**: This specification covers only frontend visual design, not API design or database schemas
- **Content strategy**: Writing style guides, tone of voice, or content structure (covered in product steering)
- **Game mechanic design**: Karma system, faction alignment, or tarot interpretation logic (covered in separate specs)

## Assumptions and Dependencies

### Assumptions
- The platform will continue using Tailwind CSS v4 as the primary styling framework
- Existing Fallout color palette and CSS variables will be preserved and extended, not replaced
- The Doto font for numerics is already implemented and functional
