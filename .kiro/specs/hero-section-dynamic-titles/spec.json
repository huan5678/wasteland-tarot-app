      "change_summary": "Added comprehensive CRT screen effects: RGB pixel grid overlay with dual linear-gradient (3px×3px, mix-blend-mode: multiply) and static chromatic aberration (red/blue text-shadow as base layer). Includes detailed acceptance criteria for grid rendering, static color separation, effect composition, CSS variables for tuning, accessibility considerations, and graceful degradation strategies. Updated Technical Constraints and Success Criteria accordingly."

Key achievements: (1) Created 6 CSS variables in globals.css for tunable CRT parameters, (2) Implemented RGB pixel grid overlay using ::after pseudo-element with dual linear-gradient (vertical scanlines + horizontal RGB subpixels), (3) Applied static chromatic aberration with text-shadow to main title (90% opacity), subtitle, and description (45% opacity), (4) Integrated with existing retro cursor and dynamic glitch effects, (5) Added accessibility support via prefers-reduced-motion media query (reduces grid opacity to 50%), (6) Implemented graceful degradation with @supports query for mix-blend-mode, (7) Applied CSS Module classes to JSX components, (8) Created comprehensive E2E test suite (tests/e2e/hero-crt-effects.spec.ts) with 11 test cases covering DOM structure, CSS variables, visual effects, and accessibility. Fixed CSS Modules :root selector issue by moving variables to globals.css. Server compiles successfully (200 OK)."
