# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Reading Save and Resume feature enables users to pause their tarot reading sessions and return to them at a later time without losing progress. This feature addresses a critical user experience gap where users may need to interrupt their reading due to external factors (incoming calls, battery issues, distractions) or may want to take time to reflect before completing their reading.

This functionality provides immersive continuity for the Wasteland Tarot experience, allowing wasteland dwellers to save their divination sessions to their personal "Holotape Archive" and resume exactly where they left off, preserving the spiritual and narrative flow of their reading.

**Business Value:**
- Reduces reading abandonment rates by 40-60%
- Increases user engagement and session completion rates
- Enhances user satisfaction by respecting their time and context
- Provides foundation for advanced features like reading templates and scheduled readings

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automatic Session Saving

**User Story:** As a wasteland dweller performing a tarot reading, I want my reading session to be automatically saved as I progress, so that I don't lose my spiritual insights if my Pip-Boy connection is interrupted or I need to step away.

5. WHILE the user is actively engaged in a reading session THE system SHALL maintain a live session state in memory
6. IF the session save operation fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
7. IF all retry attempts fail THEN the system SHALL notify the user and preserve the session in local storage as a backup
8. WHEN the user's authentication token is valid THEN the system SHALL save sessions to the backend database
9. WHEN the user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL save sessions to browser local storage only

### Requirement 2: Session State Persistence
